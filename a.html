          Hey, my name is Kering Alvin and I use <kering class="v2"></kering> as my nickname across
          social medias. Iâ€™m a web developer, UX/UI designer & front-end web
          developer from canada. Iâ€™m also passionate about trap drill and amapiano music and make
          portraits and universes around what I listen to and Iâ€™m always curious
          to learn more when it comes to new technologies and creative coding.
